**llm-for-zotero** is a plugin for [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) that integrates Large Language Models directly into the Zotero PDF reader. Unlike tools that require uploading PDFs to a web portal, this plugin lets you chat with your papers without leaving Zotero. It sits quietly in the reader sidebar — your standby research assistant, ready whenever you need it.

### 📢 Recent Updates

- **Codex App Server (recommended)** — ChatGPT Plus subscribers should use the new local `codex app-server` runtime for Codex models (e.g. `gpt-5.5`) without an API key. Enable it from the **Agent** tab; the older direct backend flow remains as a legacy option for current users. See [Codex Setup](#codex-setup-chatgpt-plus-subscribers). Feature contributed by [@jianghao-zhang](https://github.com/jianghao-zhang) and [@boltma](https://github.com/boltma).
- **Claude Code Mode (experimental)** — Run Claude Code as a separate conversation system inside Zotero through the companion local bridge. This mode is still under development and does not yet support native Zotero API operations; native Zotero tool support is planned. See [Claude Code Setup](#claude-code-setup-experimental). This feature is contributed by [@jianghao-zhang](https://github.com/jianghao-zhang).
- **Skills** — Customizable guidance files that shape how the agent handles different tasks. 8 built-in skills included, plus a portal for creating your own. See [Skills](#skills).
- **Standalone Window Mode** — Open the LLM Assistant in its own dedicated window, separate from the Zotero reader sidebar. See [Standalone Window Mode](#standalone-window-mode).
- **File-Based Notes** — Save research notes as Markdown files in any local directory — works with Obsidian, Logseq, or any plain markdown folder. See [File-Based Notes](#file-based-notes).
- **Agent Mode (beta)** — LLM-for-Zotero can now act as an autonomous agent inside your Zotero library. See [Agent Mode](#agent-mode-beta) for details.
- **MinerU PDF parsing** — High-fidelity PDF extraction that preserves tables, equations, and figures. See [MinerU PDF Parsing](#mineru-pdf-parsing).

---

## Configuration

Open `Preferences` → navigate to the `llm-for-zotero` tab.

1. Select your **Provider** (e.g. OpenAI, Gemini, Deepseek).
2. Paste your **API Base URL**, **secret key**, and **model name**.
3. Click **Test Connection** to verify.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/model_setting.gif" alt="Animation showing provider and model configuration" width="1024" />
</p>

The plugin natively supports multiple provider protocols: `responses_api`, `openai_chat_compat`, `anthropic_messages`, `gemini_native`, and more.

### Supported Models (examples)

| API URL                                     | Model                | Reasoning Levels                  | Notes                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`       | gpt-5.4              | default, low, medium, high, xhigh | PDF uploads supported |
| `https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`       | gpt-5.4-pro          | medium, high, xhigh               | PDF uploads supported |
| `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`               | deepseek-chat        | default                           |                       |
| `https://api.deepseek.com/anthropic`        | deepseek-v4-flash    | default                           |                       |
| `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | gemini-3-pro-preview | low, high                         |                       |
| `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | gemini-2.5-flash     | medium                            |                       |
| `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | gemini-2.5-pro       | default, low, high                |                       |
| `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`                | kimi-k2.5            | default                           |                       |

You can also set up **multiple providers**, each with multiple models for different tasks (e.g. a multimodal model for figures, a text model for summaries). Cross-check answers across models for more comprehensive understanding.

### Advanced: Reasoning Levels & Hyperparameters

You can set different reasoning levels per model in the conversation panel (e.g. "default", "low", "medium", "high", "xhigh") depending on model support. Power users can also adjust hyperparameters like `temperature`, `max_tokens_output`, etc. for more creative or deterministic responses.

---

## Usage Guide

1. **Open any PDF** in the Zotero reader.
2. **Click the LLM Assistant icon** in the right-hand toolbar to open the sidebar.
3. **Type a question** such as _"What is the main conclusion of this paper?"_

On the first message, the model loads the full paper content as context. Follow-up questions use focused retrieval from the same paper, so the conversation stays fast and relevant.

---

## Features

### Grounded Answers with One-Click Source Navigation

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/citation_jump.gif" alt="Animation showing one-click jump from an AI citation to the paper source" width="1024" />
</p>

### Paper Summarization

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/summarize.gif" alt="Animation showing an instant paper summary in the sidebar" width="1024" />
</p>

Get a concise summary of any paper in seconds. The summary is generated from the full text of the open PDF, and you can customize the prompt (e.g. focus on methodology, results, or implications).

### Selected Text Explanation

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/text.gif" alt="Animation showing selected text being explained by the model" width="1024" />
</p>

Select any complex paragraph or technical term and ask the model to explain it. You can add up to 5 pieces of context from the model's answer or the paper to refine the explanation.

An optional pop-up lets you add selected text to the chat with one click. Don't like it? Disable it in settings — your choice.

### Figure Interpretation

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/screenshot.gif" alt="Animation showing screenshot-based figure interpretation" width="1024" />

## Standalone Window Mode

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/standalone_window.png" alt="Screenshot of the LLM Assistant standalone window" width="1024" />
</p>

Open the LLM Assistant in its own dedicated window, separate from the Zotero reader sidebar. The standalone window gives you a full-sized chat interface with a collapsible conversation history panel on the left.

- **Keyboard shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+L` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+L`)
- **Paper chat & Library chat:** Switch between paper-specific and library-wide conversations using the tabs at the top.
- **Conversation history:** Browse past conversations organized by date (Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30 days, Older) in the left sidebar.
- **All features available:** Everything you can do in the reader sidebar — screenshots, file uploads, agent mode, quick-action presets — works identically in the standalone window.

While the standalone window is open, the reader sidebar panels display a placeholder with options to focus the window or close it and return to the sidebar.

---

## File-Based Notes

Beyond Zotero's built-in notes, the agent can save research notes as Markdown files in any local directory you choose. The plugin is **not tied to any specific note-taking app** — point it at an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, a [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) graph, or a plain folder of `.md` files, and the agent will write notes there with full metadata, citations, and optionally extracted figures.

### Configuration

Open `Preferences` → `llm-for-zotero` and scroll to the **Notes Directory** section.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/outside_notes.png" alt="Screenshot of the Notes Directory settings panel" width="512" />
</p>

| Setting                  | Description                                                                                  | Example              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Nickname**             | How you refer to this directory in chat — the agent recognizes the name when you mention it  | `Obsidian`, `Logseq` |
| **Notes Directory Path** | Absolute path to the root directory where notes are saved                                    | `/Users/me/MyVault`  |
| **Default Folder**       | Default subfolder for new notes (the agent can write to a different folder if you ask it to) | `Logs`               |
| **Attachments Folder**   | Folder for copied figures and images, **relative to the directory root**                     | `Logs/imgs`          |

Click **Test Write Access** to verify the plugin can write to your directory.

### How it works

Ask the agent to write a note using the nickname you configured — e.g. _"Summarize this paper and save it to Obsidian"_ or _"Log this to my Logseq"_. The agent will:

1. Gather content from the paper (metadata, summary, key points, figures, etc.).
2. Compose a Markdown note following the conventions of the `write-note` skill.
3. Add YAML frontmatter that matches the `write-note` template (`title`, `created`, `tags`, `citekey`, `doi`, `journal`); author information is kept in the note body, not frontmatter.
4. Optionally copy figures from MinerU-parsed PDFs into the attachments folder.
5. Write the note to `{notes_directory}/{default_folder}/{title}.md`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/obsidian_example.png" alt="Example of a paper note rendered in Obsidian" width="1024" />
</p>

Notes use [Pandoc citation syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations) (`[@citekey]`), compatible with Obsidian's Zotero Integration and Pandoc plugins, as well as most other Markdown readers.

> **Customizing the note format:** Note templates and figure-embedding rules live in the `write-note` skill, not in preferences. Open the **Standalone Window** → **Skills** portal to edit it — see the [Skills](#skills) section for details.

---

## Agent Mode (beta)

> Agent Mode is disabled by default. Enable it in Preferences, then toggle `Agent (beta)` in the context bar.

When enabled, the LLM becomes an autonomous agent that can read, search, and write within your Zotero library.

### Available Tools

The agent ships with focused tools split into **read** (no confirmation needed) and **write** (route through a confirmation card with batched undo).

#### Library & PDF reading

| Tool                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `view_pdf_pages`           | Render PDF pages as images for visual analysis — by question, by page number, or capture the currently visible page                                                              |
| `read_attachment`          | Read any Zotero attachment by ID (HTML snapshots, text files, images), or send the whole file to the model                                                                       |
| `search_literature_online` | Search live scholarly sources (CrossRef, Semantic Scholar) for metadata, recommendations, references, citations                                                                  |

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apply_tags`         | Add or remove tags on one or more papers                                              |
| `update_metadata`    | Update metadata fields (title, authors, DOI, etc.) on an item                         |
| `move_to_collection` | Add or remove papers from collections                                                 |
| `manage_collections` | Create or delete collections (folders)                                                |
| `manage_attachments` | Delete, rename, or re-link broken attachment file paths                               |
| `merge_items`        | Merge duplicates — keeps the master, moves children from the others, trashes the rest |
| `trash_items`        | Move items to the trash                                                               |
| `import_identifiers` | Import papers by DOI, ISBN, arXiv ID, or URL                                          |
| `import_local_files` | Import local files (PDFs, etc.) — Zotero auto-fetches metadata for recognized PDFs    |
| `edit_current_note`  | Edit the active Zotero note or create a new one (plain text, Markdown, or HTML)       |

#### Filesystem & scripting

| Tool            | Description                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file_io`       | Read or write files on the local filesystem — text and image, with offset/length for partial reads         |
| `run_command`   | Run a shell command (zsh on macOS, bash on Linux, cmd.exe on Windows) — for analysis scripts and CLI tools |
| `zotero_script` | Execute JavaScript inside Zotero's runtime — read mode for bulk data, write mode for custom mutations      |

#### Safety net

| Tool               | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `undo_last_action` | Undo the most recent write action in this conversation — keeps the last 10 entries per session |

The design philosophy is **read tools are unrestricted; write tools always confirm and stay undoable**. Ask the agent what it can do — it will tell you.

## Skills

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/skills.png" alt="Screenshot of the Skills management portal" width="512" />
</p>

Skills are customizable guidance files that shape how the agent approaches different types of requests. When your message matches a skill's trigger patterns, the skill's instructions are automatically injected into the agent's prompt — guiding it to use the most efficient tools and workflows for the task.

> Skills require **Agent Mode** to be enabled. They have no effect in standard chat mode.

The plugin ships with **8 built-in skills** covering common research workflows:

| Skill                    | What it guides the agent to do                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `simple-paper-qa`        | Answer general questions about a paper efficiently (read once, answer immediately)                                        |
| `evidence-based-qa`      | Find specific methods, results, or evidence with targeted retrieval                                                       |
| `analyze-figures`        | Interpret figures and tables using MinerU-extracted images                                                                |
| `compare-papers`         | Compare multiple papers using batched reads and focused retrieval                                                         |
| `library-analysis`       | Summarize or analyze your entire library without context overflow                                                         |
| `literature-review`      | Conduct a structured literature review (discover, read, synthesize)                                                       |
| `write-note`             | Write reading notes either as Zotero notes or as Markdown files in your notes directory (Obsidian, Logseq, plain folders) |

## WebChat Setup (ChatGPT Web Sync)

**WebChat mode** lets you send questions directly to [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) through a browser extension — no API key needed. Your queries are relayed from Zotero to the ChatGPT web interface, and responses are streamed back into the plugin.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/webchat.jpeg" alt="webchat demo" width="1024" />
</p>

### Prerequisites

- A ChatGPT account (Free, Plus, or Team)
- A Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, etc.)

### Step-by-step setup

1. **Download the browser extension:**
   - Go to [github.com/yilewang/sync-for-zotero](https://github.com/yilewang/sync-for-zotero) → **Releases**
   - Download the latest `extension.zip`
   - Unzip the file to a folder on your computer

2. **Install the extension (sideload):**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped extension folder
   - The "Sync for Zotero" extension should now appear in your extensions list

3. **Configure the plugin:**
   - Open Zotero → `Preferences` → `llm-for-zotero`
   - Set **Auth Mode** → `WebChat`
   - The model is automatically set to `chatgpt.com`

4. **Start chatting:**
   - Open a ChatGPT tab in your browser (keep it open while using WebChat)
   - Open a paper in Zotero — the plugin panel shows the "chatgpt.com" indicator with a connection dot
   - A green dot means connected; red means the extension or ChatGPT tab is not detected
   - Type a question and send — the plugin relays it to ChatGPT and streams the response back

### WebChat features

- **PDF attachment**: Right-click the paper chip to toggle PDF sending (purple = send, grey = skip)
- **Screenshots**: Use the camera button to attach figure screenshots to your message
- **Conversation history**: Click the clock icon to browse and load past ChatGPT conversations
- **Exit**: Click the "Exit" button to return to regular API mode

## Codex Setup (ChatGPT Plus Subscribers)

If you have a ChatGPT Plus subscription, you can use Codex models (e.g. `gpt-5.4`) in the plugin without a separate API key by signing in through the Codex CLI.

There are two Codex-backed paths in the plugin. New users should choose **Codex App Server**.

- **Codex App Server (Recommended)** - Spawns the local `codex app-server` CLI and talks to it over stdio. This is the official way to use Codex in third-party apps, and it is the preferred setup for new users. It is configured from the **Agent** tab and appears as a dedicated **Codex** button in the chat header.
- **Codex Auth (Legacy)** - Uses the ChatGPT/Codex Responses backend directly. Existing users can keep using it in the next release, but new users should choose `Codex App Server`. This legacy mode is planned for deprecation in a future release after app-server validation.

Codex App Server threads created from Zotero are regular app-server threads bound to the active Zotero profile and library. The Codex Mac app may not show these conversations unless it requests `sourceKinds: ["appServer"]` when listing threads; Zotero verifies persistence through app-server history APIs and does not impersonate VS Code metadata to force visibility.

_Special thanks to [@jianghao-zhang](https://github.com/jianghao-zhang) and [@boltma](https://github.com/boltma) for contributing the Codex App Server integration._

### Step-by-step setup

1. **Install the Codex CLI** (one-time):
   - **macOS:** Install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) or `brew install node`, then:

     ```bash
     npm install -g @openai/codex
     ```

   - **macOS (Homebrew alternative):** `brew install --cask codex` (no Node.js needed).
   - **Windows/Linux:** Install [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/), then `npm install -g @openai/codex`. On Windows, a Codex CLI installed inside WSL is also supported; run `codex login` inside the same WSL distro you want Zotero to use.

2. **Log in with your ChatGPT account:**

   ```bash
   codex login
   ```

   A browser window opens — sign in with your ChatGPT Plus account. Credentials are saved to `~/.codex/auth.json`. If you use Codex from WSL on Windows, run `codex login` inside that same WSL distro.

3. **Enable Codex App Server in Zotero**:
   - Open Zotero → `Preferences` → `llm-for-zotero` → **Agent** tab.
   - Set **Enable Codex App Server integration** → `On`.
   - Choose the default **Model** (e.g. `gpt-5.4`) and **Reasoning** level.
   - Click **Test connection** to verify that Zotero can launch `codex app-server`.
   - In the chat header, click the **Codex** button to switch into the Codex conversation system.

   `Codex App Server` and `Claude Code` are mutually exclusive runtime modes in the Agent tab. Disable one before enabling the other.

4. **Legacy fallback for existing users**:
   - Open the **AI Providers** tab.
   - Choose **Auth Mode** → `Codex Auth (Legacy)`.
   - Keep API URL `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`.
   - Keep your Codex model name (e.g. `gpt-5.5`).
   - Existing users can keep this configuration unchanged while `Codex App Server` is validated as the long-term replacement.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/codex_claude.png" alt="Screenshot showing recommended Codex App Server configuration in plugin settings" width="1024" />
</p>

### Codex Auth (Legacy) Technical Notes

- Reads local credentials from `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`).
- Automatically attempts token refresh on 401 responses.
- Embeddings are not supported in this legacy direct mode yet.
- Local PDF/reference text grounding and screenshot/image inputs are supported.
- The Responses `/files` upload + `file_id` attachment flow is not supported yet.

## Claude Code Setup (Experimental)

Claude Code mode runs Claude Code as a separate conversation system inside Zotero. It reuses the familiar sidebar and standalone-window UI, but it has its own conversation history, `paper` / `open` scope state, model/reasoning settings, permission semantics, slash commands, and project skills.

> **Status:** Claude Code mode is under active development. It currently does **not** support native Zotero API operations from Claude Code. Use the built-in [Agent Mode](#agent-mode-beta) for native Zotero library tools such as reading structured item state, editing notes, tagging papers, updating metadata, or importing items. Native Zotero API support for Claude Code is planned for a later release.

### Prerequisites

- A working Claude Code CLI installation. Follow the official [Claude Code installation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/installation.md), [quickstart](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart.md), and [authentication](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication.md) docs.
- The `claude` command must be on `PATH` and authenticated. Run `claude` in a terminal first; if Claude Code is not installed, not on `PATH`, or not logged in, Zotero's Claude Code mode will not work.
- Node.js and npm for the companion bridge adapter.

### 1. Install and verify Claude Code

Install Claude Code using Anthropic's official instructions, then run:

```bash
claude
```

Complete any login or authentication prompts in Claude Code before continuing.

### 2. Start the Zotero Claude bridge

Claude Code mode depends on the companion bridge repo [`cc-llm4zotero-adapter`](https://github.com/jianghao-zhang/cc-llm4zotero-adapter). The bridge does not replace Claude Code; it connects Zotero to your local Claude Code runtime.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jianghao-zhang/cc-llm4zotero-adapter.git
cd cc-llm4zotero-adapter
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve:bridge
```

In another terminal, check that the bridge is alive:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:19787/healthz
```

For macOS users who want the bridge to run in the background, install the LaunchAgent from the adapter repo:

```bash
./scripts/install-macos-daemon.sh
```

Useful bridge daemon commands:

```bash
npm run daemon:status
npm run daemon:start
npm run daemon:stop
npm run daemon:restart
npm run daemon:uninstall
```

If Claude Code mode stops responding, restart the bridge and re-check `/healthz`. A passing `/healthz` check only proves that the adapter is running; it does not prove that the underlying `claude` CLI is installed, authenticated, or correctly configured.

### 3. Enable Claude Code inside Zotero

Open Zotero → `Preferences` → `llm-for-zotero` → **Agent** tab.

| Setting                            | Recommended value                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Enable Claude Code integration** | `On`                               |
| **Bridge URL**                     | `http://127.0.0.1:19787`           |
| **Claude Config Source**           | `default — user + project + local` |
| **Permission Mode**                | `safe`                             |
| **Default Model**                  | `sonnet`                           |
| **Default Reasoning**              | `auto`                             |

Keep **Claude Config Source** on `default` unless you already understand Claude Code settings layers. In `default`, Claude Code can use your normal user settings plus Zotero-managed project and per-conversation local settings. The other options are:

- `user-only` — only your machine-wide Claude settings.
- `zotero-only` — only Zotero-managed project and local settings.

After enabling the integration, click the **Claude Code** button in the chat header to enter Claude Code mode. The Claude conversation system is separate from upstream chat and the built-in agent, so switching modes opens the matching conversation history instead of mixing transcripts.

### 4. Prepare Claude project skills and commands

Zotero creates a Claude runtime root under your home directory, usually shaped like:

```text
~/Zotero/agent-runtime/profile-.../
```

Inside that runtime root, shared Claude project assets live in:

```text
CLAUDE.md
.claude/settings.json
.claude/skills/
.claude/commands/
```

Each Claude conversation also gets its own local `.claude` folder under the runtime `scopes/` tree, so per-conversation overrides do not leak into other chats. You can add shared Claude skills manually under `.claude/skills/` or `.claude/commands/`, but the easiest path is usually to ask Claude Code to create or install the skill in the Zotero project-level Claude config.

### Notes for non-Anthropic Claude Code setups

The Zotero UI exposes `opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku` as capability tiers. They do not require Anthropic-hosted models specifically. If you route Claude Code through a compatible provider layer or proxy, configure that in Claude Code itself; Zotero only selects the tier and forwards the request to the bridge.

## MinerU PDF Parsing

**MinerU** is an advanced PDF parsing engine that extracts high-fidelity Markdown from PDFs — preserving tables, equations, figures, and complex layouts that standard text extraction often mangles. When enabled, the plugin sends your PDF to the MinerU API for parsing and caches the result locally. All subsequent interactions with that paper use the MinerU-parsed content, giving the LLM much richer and more accurate context.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/minerU.png" alt="Screenshot showing MinerU PDF parsing results in the plugin" width="1024" />
</p>

### How to enable MinerU

1. Open Zotero → `Preferences` → `llm-for-zotero` tab.
2. Find the **MinerU** section and check **Enable MinerU**.
3. (Optional) Enter your own MinerU API key — see below.
4. Open any PDF and start chatting. The plugin will automatically parse the PDF with MinerU on first use and cache the result for future conversations.

### Using your own API key

The plugin provides a shared community proxy so MinerU works out of the box without an API key. However, the shared quota is limited. For heavier usage, you can apply for your own key:

1. Go to [mineru.net](https://mineru.net) and create an account.
2. Navigate to your account settings and generate an API key.
3. In Zotero → `Preferences` → `llm-for-zotero` → **MinerU** section, paste your API key.
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify.

When a personal API key is provided, the plugin calls the MinerU API directly (`https://mineru.net/api/v4`). Without a key, it uses the community proxy.

</p>

> **Q: Does it work with local models?**
>
> Yes — as long as the local model provides an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API, you can connect it by entering the appropriate API Base URL and key in settings.

> **Q: Is my data used to train models?**
>
> No. You use your own API key, so data privacy is governed by the terms of your chosen provider (e.g. OpenAI's API terms typically exclude training on API data).

> **Q: How do I report a bug or ask a question?**
>
> Please [open an issue](https://github.com/yilewang/llm-for-zotero/issues) on GitHub. I'll do my best to help!
